We have, in particular, taken appropriate security measures to protect your personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Access is only granted on a need-to-know basis to those people whose roles require them to process your personal data. You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your personal data. For instance, you should not disclose any personal information via text to the Syndi app. You are responsible for maintaining the security of any device on which you utilize the Services. Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
